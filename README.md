#### 3.Clone Git repository and import Maven project
   - Open https://github.com/SAP/cloud-espm-v2 with your web browser.
   - Click on the Copy to clipboard so that the Git repository URL of the opened GitHub repository is copied to your clipboard.

![Repo URL](/docs/images/CloneGithub-Repo.png?raw=true)

   - In Eclipse, open the Git perspective. From the Eclipse IDE main menu, choose Window > Open Perspective > Other.... Select Git and choose Ok to open the Git perspective. 
   - In this perspective you have the Git Repositories view on the left. As long as there is no Git Repository defined you will see 3 links (as shown here) to add a repository to the view.

![Git Clone](/docs/images/CloneGit.png?raw=true)

   - In the corresponding menu (top-right of the view), click on the Clone a Git repository link.
   - Because you copied before the ESPM repository URL to your clipboard, the fields (URI, Host, Repository path and Protocol) of the opened dialog are filled automatically with the correct values.
   - Do not change anything, just click Next >.
   - On this wizard page check that the base branch is selected and click again on Next >.
   - On the last wizard page you can adjust the location of the local Git Repository, but for the scope of this tutorial we'll just leave the default as-is.
   - Click on Finish so that the remote ESPM repository (source code) is cloned to the local location specified on the last wizard page.
   - In Eclipse, open File->Import->Existing Maven projects and import the Maven project.

#### 4.Update dependencies and build Maven project
   - Instruction to run update dependencies for the Maven project
     - Right click on the web project in ESPM > and choose Maven > Click on Update Project
![Maven Update](/docs/images/MavenUpdate.png?raw=true)

   - Note! If you face errors you need to modify the parent pom.xml for certain property values depending on your environment:
     - local.server.proxy.settings - delete this if you are not behind a proxy server, else update your proxy settings here
     - browser.proxy.settings - delete this if your browser is not using a proxy, else update your browser proxy settings here
     - sap.cloud.sdk.version - The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for Java Web Tomcat 8 version that you intend to run the application with,is version 3.20.3.1
     - olingo.version - The Apache Olingo version that you intend the application to run with, the minimum version supported is 2.0.6
    
 The application can be built with the maven command to the parent pom.xml

 ```sh
 clean install
   ```
After building the application update the Maven Project :
 
  Right click on the web project in ESPM > and choose Maven > Click on Update Project
    
**The unit tests and the integration tests are run by default when building the project with goal "clean install"**

#### 5.Deploy the application on local Cloud Runtime

i)Run the application in HCP Java Web Tomcat 8 Server

- Right click on the web project in ESPM > and choose the Run on Server option
       
![Run ESPM Locally](/docs/images/RunESPM1.png?raw=true)

- Make sure that Manually define a new server is selected and choose SAP > Java Web Tomcat 8 Server as server type. Leave all other settings unchanged and choose Finish

![Run ESPM Finish](/docs/images/RunESPM2.png?raw=true)

- Now a local server is started that has your espm application deployed.

ii)Create Users and Assign Role

- To enable local users to access the Retailer UI, you need to define user IDs in the local user store and assigned the role “Retailer” to this user. 
       
  Create a user with the below information
            
            		ID	Name	 Password	Role
            		ret   	ret       123	       Retailer

![Create User locally](/docs/images/localuser.png?raw=true)

  - The eCommerce site can be accessed via the URL: https://localhost:<port\>/espm-cloud-web/webshop
  - The Retailer UI can be accessed via the URL: https://localhost:<port\>/espm-cloud-web/retailer

#### 6.Deploy the application on SAP HCP via the cockpit

 **Note! The application name must be "espm", else the above URL will change based on the application name given during deployment**
 
   - Deploy the application in your SAP Cloud Platform Trial account. 
   
1.Go to HCP Cockpit --> Click on Java Application under Applications --> Click on Deploy Application
    
![HCP Cockpit](/docs/images/HCPCockpit.png?raw=true)

# 2.Deep-dive guide
### Architecture Overview
The following diagram provides an overview of the ESPM Sample application architecture: 

![Architecture Diagram](/docs/images/architecture.jpg?raw=true)

Reading the above architecture diagram from top to bottom, we have the following components

 - **SAPUI5 layer** - All the front-end code of the application is written in SAPUI5. The end user accesses the application using web browser (preferably latest Google Chrome)
 - **OData layer** - The ESPM application services are implemented in OData version 2.0. We use Apache Olingo for transforming JPA Models into OData Services. For more information on Apache Olingo JPA Models transformation to OData services, see [Details](http://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata2/tutorials/CreateWebApp.html) 
 - **JPA Layer** - The persistence of the application is implemented using Java JPA. We use EclipseLink as the persistence provider
 - **Persistence** - The persistence used for the application is SAP HANA DB in Cloud (HCP). All the tables modelled in Java JPA are created in the HANA DB

The ESPM Sample Application is a Maven based project which has a parent pom.xml file and 2 sub projects as below 

 - **espm-cloud-jpa** - This project contains the source code implementation for the backend/JPA along with unit tests. Below is the JPA Class diagram.
 - **espm-cloud-web** - This project contains the source code implementation for generating the odata services for JPA entities implemented in "espm-cloud-jpa" and front end of the application created using SAPUI5. The OData integration tests are also implemented in this package

### The JPA Class diagram

![JPA Class Diagram](/docs/images/espm-cloud-jpa.png?raw=true)

### ESPM Source Code packages
**The espm-cloud-jpa has the following packages:**

* src/main/java
	* com.sap.espm.model - JPA Model classes for persistence
	* com.sap.espm.model.data - Data loader classes to populate the master data for the eCommerce site like Product information etc
	* com.sap.espm.model.util - The utility classses

* src/main/resources
	* com.sap.espm.model.data - XML files containing master data for the eCommerce site like Products, Product Categories etc

* src/test/java
	* com.sap.espm.model - The Unit tests for the database entities
	* com.sap.espm.model.util - The test factory class

**espm-cloud-web has the following packages:**

* src/main/java
	* com.sap.espm.model.function.impl - The classes for function import implementation for odata services using Apache Olingo
	* com.sap.espm.model.web - the Startup servlet and Apache Olingo OData service implementation classes

* src/test/java
	* com.sap.espm.model.web - The OData integration tests classes
	* com.sap.espm.model.web.util - The utility classes for the tests

* src/test/resources
	* com.sap.espm.model.web - The XML files for the OData Integration tests

**The UI is located in webapps folder. The frontend is implemented in SAPUI5.**
### Securing OData Services

* The ESPM application consists of 2 parts - **ESPM Webshop** and **ESPM Retailer**. The application is split into 2 parts by a secure URL and non-secure URL.

        Secure URL:
        http://<appname><accountname>.hana.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/espm.svc/secure
        
        Non secure URL
        http://<appname><accountname>.hana.ondemand.com/espm-cloud-web/espm.svc/

* The WebShop application uses non secure URL as any user without any logon credentials can create a sales order. The Retailer application uses secure URL as only a user with Java EE Web role Retailer can access it. To implement security we use a mix of Java EE Web roles and Servlet Filter

![Web.xml for security](/docs/images/webxml.png?raw=true)
* Any access to the secure entity and respective HTTP method via secure url (../espm.svc/secure/)is secured by Java EE Web role Retailer. The form authentication is specified for this Retailer and url-pattern /espm.svc/secure is restricted to this role. This is translated to SAML authentication on deploying in cloud

![Secure URL](/docs/images/secureurl.png?raw=true)
* Any access to secure entity and respective HTTP via non-secure url is restricted by a servlet filter. The servlet filter is defined under the package com.sap.espm.model.web as EspmServiceFactoryFilter class and specified in the web.xml. The logic for restricting access to secure entities via non-secure url is implemented in isPathRestricted()

![Secure URL](/docs/images/servletfilter.png?raw=true)

After deploying the application in HCP, assign the Retailer role to the user who will act as the retailer of the eCommerce site. Please refer to documentation of SAP Cloud Platform on how to assign roles to users. See [Details](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?db8175b9d976101484e6fa303b108acd.html)
